This is a collection of various programs I have written for my [Z80 computer](https://github.com/CoolBassist/Z80-computer). 

# Plans
## RPN calculator
No good computer is without a calculator.

## JForth interpreter
I hope to write an interpreter for [my JForth language](https://github.com/CoolBassist/JFORTH), it will have all the features that my C++/C# implementations have. I have some vague ideas about how I will implement it, might use some form of state machine to get what (if any) keyword a token is. Or I might implement a strcmp function, ala C.

## J-OS
A homebrew OS on a homebrew computer would be cool. It would have the ability to enter commands to write to certain locations in memory as a form of crude file system, and ability to enter machine code, and then execute it. 

Would need to add an external form of memory to the hardware such as a cassette.
